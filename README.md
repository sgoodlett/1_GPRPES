## Gaussian Process Regression for Potential Energy Surface Modeling
# **TODO**
* Add Sparse Gaussian Processes
* Add Multifidelity Gaussian Processes
* Give more user control over GP optimization
* Add ARD to GP methods
* Give Hyperopt control over kernel selection

# Done
* Migrated to GPFlow instead of GPy
* Added optimization with restarts method
